Updated Final Project for CS 5001: Intensive Foundations of Computer Science at Northeastern University \n

For this project, I wanted to utilize the practices I learned in my Object Oriented Design course to update a project I did in my Foundations of CS course which I took in the Fall.
In the original project, I utilized procedural methods in order to carry out this task.
In this new version, object oriented practices allowed me to drastically reduce the amount of code I produced procedurally and made my project much more uniform in the process.
